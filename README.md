# DataBricksOperation

## Overview  
This repository demonstrates two key tasks performed using Databricks:  
- Converting an existing table into a Delta table using SQL  
- Filtering filenames to select only `.csv` files using Python list comprehension  

---

## Tasks Included

### 1. Create a Delta Table from an Existing Table (SQL)  
**Script:** Located in `SQL_DeltaTablePractice.ipynb`  
**Description:** Using SQL in Databricks, the script reads from an existing table and creates a new table in Delta format.
